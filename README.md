# C++-Artificial-Neural-Network-Genetic-Algorithm
Neural network that is trained via a Genetic algorthm

This was part of an assignment for my advanced diploma at AIE.

The assignment was to create and use a static library. For this I decided to use a personal project where a neural network is trained via a genetic algorithm.

In the given project, the example used was to feed in a 3 bit number x, and the output would be x + 1, so: 000 = 001, 001 = 010, 010 = 011... 111 - 000

I've included 3 non-linear activation functions that can be used, each takes a different time to train the model.
